# ATM Transaction Simulator in C

Welcome to the ATM Transaction Simulator project! This repository showcases a comprehensive embedded systems simulation of an ATM's transaction process using the C programming language. The simulator covers user authentication, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and receipt generation, while also incorporating error handling and security measures.

## Project Highlights

- **Secure User Authentication:** Implement a robust authentication mechanism for users.
- **Accurate Balance Inquiries:** Fetch and display account balances accurately for simulated users.
- **Seamless Fund Transfers:** Enable smooth fund transfers between accounts with data integrity checks.
- **Transaction Receipt Generation:** Generate detailed receipts for successful transactions.
- **Rigorous Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error-handling mechanisms for a seamless user experience.
- **Security Measures:** Employ secure coding practices and encryption techniques for data protection.
- **Modular and Organized Structure:** Divide the project into well-structured components for readability and maintenance.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-simulator.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd atm-simulator`.
3. Compile the C code: `gcc -o atm_simulator main.c authentication.c balance.c transfer.c receipt.c error_handling.c`.
4. Run the simulator: `./atm_simulator`.

Follow the on-screen prompts to experience the ATM transaction process and interact with the simulation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.c`: Main program that integrates different modules.
- `authentication.c`: Handles user authentication.
- `balance.c`: Manages balance inquiries.
- `transfer.c`: Facilitates fund transfers between accounts.
- `receipt.c`: Generates transaction receipts.
- `error_handling.c`: Implements error handling mechanisms.

## Future Improvements

As this project evolves, I plan to:
- Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
- Explore advanced security measures, including more encryption techniques.
- Incorporate additional transaction types and features.
- Refine error messages and notifications for better user guidance.
